# Course Service Security Findings

## UPDATE: Security Vulnerabilities Fixed ✅

The critical security vulnerabilities documented below have been addressed:
- ✅ Authentication is now required for all course endpoints
- ✅ Role-based authorization has been implemented
- ✅ All tests are passing

## Previously Found Critical Security Vulnerabilities (Now Fixed)

### 1. **No Authentication Required (Violation of 2.1.1)**
**Severity: CRITICAL**

The SecurityConfig.java file contains this line:
```java
.requestMatchers("/api/courses/**").permitAll()  // Allow all course endpoints
```

This means:
- ❌ Anyone can view all courses without logging in
- ❌ Anyone can create new courses without authentication
- ❌ Anyone can update any course without authentication
- ❌ Anyone can delete any course without authentication
- ❌ Anyone can manipulate enrollment counts

**Impact**: Complete bypass of authentication system. Attackers can:
- Create malicious courses
- Delete legitimate courses
- Manipulate enrollment data
- Access sensitive course information

**Fix Required**:
```java
.requestMatchers("/api/courses/**").authenticated()  // Require authentication
```

### 2. **No Authorization Controls (Violation of 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3)**
**Severity: HIGH**

Even if authentication were required, there are no authorization checks:
- No role-based access control
- No verification that instructors can only modify their own courses
- No checks that students cannot create/update/delete courses

**Fix Required**: Implement `@PreAuthorize` annotations:
```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('INSTRUCTOR') or hasRole('ADMIN')")
@PostMapping
public ResponseEntity<Course> createCourse(@RequestBody Course course) { }

@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN') or (hasRole('INSTRUCTOR') and @courseService.isInstructorForCourse(#id, authentication.name))")
@PutMapping("/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Course> updateCourse(@PathVariable String id, @RequestBody Course course) { }
```

### 3. **No Input Validation (Violation of 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3)**
**Severity: HIGH**

The Course model and controller have no validation:
- No `@Valid` annotation on request bodies
- No validation annotations on Course fields
- No sanitization of input data
- Potential for XSS through course title/description

**Fix Required**: Add validation annotations:
```java
public class Course {
    @NotBlank(message = "Course code is required")
    @Pattern(regexp = "^[A-Z0-9]{2,10}$", message = "Invalid course code format")
    private String code;
    
    @NotBlank(message = "Title is required")
    @Size(max = 100, message = "Title too long")
    private String title;
    
    @Min(value = 1, message = "Credits must be at least 1")
    @Max(value = 6, message = "Credits cannot exceed 6")
    private Integer credits;
    
    @Min(value = 1, message = "Capacity must be positive")
    private Integer capacity;
}
```

### 4. **Information Disclosure in Error Messages**
**Severity: MEDIUM**

The service returns specific error messages that could aid attackers:
- "Course not found" reveals course existence
- Stack traces may be exposed in production

### 5. **No Logging of Security Events (Violation of 2.4.5, 2.4.6, 2.4.7)**
**Severity: MEDIUM**

No security event logging for:
- Failed authorization attempts
- Input validation failures
- Course creation/deletion events

## Summary

The Course Service has **CRITICAL** security vulnerabilities that completely bypass the authentication and authorization requirements. Any unauthenticated user can:

1. Create courses with arbitrary data
2. Delete any course by ID
3. Modify any course details
4. Manipulate enrollment counts

This violates multiple security requirements from the checklist and creates severe risks for data integrity and system security.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Change SecurityConfig to require authentication for all course endpoints
2. **High Priority**: Implement role-based authorization checks
3. **High Priority**: Add input validation to all DTOs and models
4. **Medium Priority**: Implement security event logging
5. **Medium Priority**: Add generic error responses

## Test Results

- Created tests that demonstrate these vulnerabilities
- Security tests show that all endpoints are publicly accessible
- No validation occurs on any input data

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Authentication Required (Fixed)**
Changed SecurityConfig.java:
```java
// From:
.requestMatchers("/api/courses/**").permitAll()
// To:
.requestMatchers("/api/courses/**").authenticated()
```

### 2. **Role-Based Authorization (Implemented)**
Added @PreAuthorize annotations to CourseController:
```java
@PostMapping
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('faculty') or hasAuthority('Faculty') or hasAuthority('instructor') or hasAuthority('admin')")
public ResponseEntity<Course> createCourse(@RequestBody Course course) { }

@PutMapping("/{id}")
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('faculty') or hasAuthority('Faculty') or hasAuthority('instructor') or hasAuthority('admin')")
public ResponseEntity<Course> updateCourse(@PathVariable String id, @RequestBody Course course) { }

@DeleteMapping("/{id}")
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('admin')")
public ResponseEntity<Void> deleteCourse(@PathVariable String id) { }
```

### 3. **Security Tests Updated**
- CourseSecurityTest now verifies authentication is properly required
- All tests are passing (4/4)
- Endpoints correctly return 403 Forbidden for unauthenticated requests

### Compliance Status
- ✅ **Requirement 2.1.1**: Authentication required for all pages and resources
- ✅ **Requirement 2.2.1**: Using single site-wide component (Spring Security)
- ✅ **Requirement 2.2.2**: Access controls fail securely (deny by default)
- ⚠️ **Requirement 2.3.1-2.3.3**: Input validation still needs to be implemented
