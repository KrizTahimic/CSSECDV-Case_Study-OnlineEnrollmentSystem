# End-to-End Security Test Status

## Overview

The end-to-end security tests have been successfully created and the test infrastructure is verified to be working. However, the full e2e tests require all microservices to be running, which is not currently the case.

## Test Creation Summary

### ✅ Completed:

1. **Created security-e2e-tests Maven module**
   - Added to parent POM
   - Configured with TestContainers for MongoDB and Redis
   - Set up REST Assured for API testing

2. **Implemented 4 comprehensive test suites:**
   - `AuthenticationE2ETest` - 7 scenarios testing authentication flows
   - `AuthorizationE2ETest` - 6 scenarios testing role-based access 
   - `SecurityAttackE2ETest` - 8 scenarios testing attack resilience
   - `DataIntegrityE2ETest` - 8 scenarios testing data consistency

3. **Created test utilities:**
   - `JwtTestUtil` - Generate valid/expired/invalid JWT tokens
   - `TestDataFactory` - Create consistent test data
   - `BaseE2ETest` - Common test setup and helpers
   - `TestContainersConfig` - Container management

4. **Fixed compilation issues:**
   - Corrected REST Assured method chaining in AuthorizationE2ETest

5. **Verified test infrastructure:**
   - Created and ran `TestInfrastructureTest` (8 tests, all passing)
   - Confirmed JWT generation working
   - Confirmed test data factories working

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites for Full E2E Tests:

The e2e tests require the following services to be running:

```bash
# 1. Start MongoDB
mongod

# 2. Start Redis
redis-server

# 3. Start Eureka Discovery Service
cd service-discovery && mvn spring-boot:run

# 4. Start Auth Service (port 3001)
cd auth-service && mvn spring-boot:run

# 5. Start Course Service (port 3002)  
cd course-service && mvn spring-boot:run

# 6. Start Enrollment Service (port 3003)
cd enrollment-service && mvn spring-boot:run

# 7. Start Grade Service (port 3004)
cd grade-service && mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Running Tests:

Once all services are running:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
cd security-e2e-tests
mvn test

# Run specific test suite
mvn test -Dtest=AuthenticationE2ETest
mvn test -Dtest=AuthorizationE2ETest
mvn test -Dtest=SecurityAttackE2ETest
mvn test -Dtest=DataIntegrityE2ETest

# Run with detailed output
mvn test -X
```

## Test Coverage

The e2e tests validate all CSSECDV security requirements:

### Authentication (2.1.x)
- ✅ Registration and login flows
- ✅ Account lockout after failed attempts
- ✅ Password complexity validation
- ✅ Re-authentication for sensitive operations
- ✅ Last login tracking
- ✅ Generic error messages

### Authorization (2.2.x)
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Cross-service authorization
- ✅ Business logic enforcement
- ✅ Fail securely (deny by default)

### Security Attacks (2.4.x)
- ✅ Brute force protection
- ✅ Token manipulation detection
- ✅ Input injection prevention
- ✅ CORS protection
- ✅ Service availability

### Data Integrity (2.3.x)
- ✅ Concurrent enrollment handling
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Data consistency
- ✅ Audit logging

## Current Status

- **Test Code**: ✅ Complete and compiled
- **Infrastructure**: ✅ Verified working
- **Full Execution**: ⏸️ Requires running services

## Next Steps

To fully execute the e2e tests:

1. Start all required services (MongoDB, Redis, all microservices)
2. Run the e2e test suite
3. Review test results and fix any failures
4. Add to CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Benefits

These e2e tests provide:
- Validation of security controls across service boundaries
- Detection of integration issues
- Assurance that security works end-to-end
- Automated regression testing
- Compliance verification for CSSECDV requirements
