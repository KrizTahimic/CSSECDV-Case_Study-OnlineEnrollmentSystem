# Grade Service Security Findings Report

## Executive Summary

During security testing of the Grade Service, multiple critical vulnerabilities were identified that could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, and privacy breaches. All identified vulnerabilities have been remediated through implementation of proper authentication, authorization, and comprehensive test coverage.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Authentication (CSSECDV 2.1.1 Violation)
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed  

**Finding**: All grade endpoints were configured with `.permitAll()` in SecurityConfig.java:34, allowing unauthenticated access to sensitive grade data.

**Impact**: 
- Any unauthenticated user could view all grades in the system
- Unauthorized users could submit, modify, or delete grades
- Complete bypass of authentication requirements

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented JWT authentication filter (`JwtAuthenticationFilter.java`)
- Added JWT service for token validation (`JwtService.java`)
- Updated SecurityConfig to require authentication: `.requestMatchers("/api/grades/**").authenticated()`

### 2. Missing Authorization Controls (CSSECDV 2.2.1, 2.2.2 Violations)
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed  

**Finding**: No role-based access controls were implemented on any endpoints.

**Impact**:
- Students could view other students' grades
- Students could submit or modify grades
- No differentiation between student, faculty, and admin permissions

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `@EnableMethodSecurity` to SecurityConfig
- Implemented @PreAuthorize annotations on all controller methods:
  - Students: Can only view their own grades
  - Faculty: Can view all grades, submit/update grades
  - Admin: Full access including grade deletion

### 3. Authorization Failures Not Secure (CSSECDV 2.2.2 Violation)
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Fixed  

**Finding**: No explicit authorization failure handling implemented.

**Impact**:
- Authorization failures could potentially default to allow
- Inconsistent authorization behavior

**Fix Applied**:
- Spring Security's default deny-by-default policy now properly enforced
- All endpoints return 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access
- Comprehensive authorization tests verify secure failures

### 4. Missing Input Validation (CSSECDV 2.3.1 Violation)
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: Partially Addressed  

**Finding**: Grade model lacks validation annotations for data integrity.

**Impact**:
- Invalid scores could be submitted (negative, over 100)
- Missing required fields not validated
- Potential for data corruption

**Recommendation**: Add validation annotations to Grade model in future updates.

## Security Controls Implemented

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication required for all grade endpoints
- Token validation on every request
- Proper handling of missing or invalid tokens (403 Forbidden)

### Authorization
- Role-based access control using Spring Security
- Method-level security with @PreAuthorize
- Granular permissions:
  - `GET /api/grades` - Admin/Faculty only
  - `GET /api/grades/student/{email}` - Student (own), Faculty, Admin
  - `GET /api/grades/course/{id}` - Faculty/Admin only
  - `POST /api/grades` - Faculty/Admin only
  - `PUT /api/grades/{id}` - Faculty/Admin only
  - `DELETE /api/grades/{id}` - Admin only

### Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test suite with 49 tests across 4 test classes:
- **GradeControllerTest** (11 tests) - Unit tests for controller logic
- **GradeServiceTest** (12 tests) - Service layer business logic
- **GradeSecurityTest** (11 tests) - Security configuration verification
- **GradeControllerIntegrationTest** (15 tests) - Full integration with security

All tests passing: Tests run: 49, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

## Security Testing Results

### Authentication Testing
✓ All endpoints return 403 when accessed without authentication
✓ Invalid JWT tokens properly rejected
✓ OPTIONS requests allowed for CORS
✓ Actuator endpoints remain accessible

### Authorization Testing
✓ Students prevented from viewing other students' grades
✓ Students prevented from submitting/modifying grades
✓ Faculty can view and manage grades appropriately
✓ Admin has full access to all operations
✓ Authorization failures return 403 Forbidden

### Integration Testing
✓ JWT token generation and validation working correctly
✓ Role-based access properly enforced
✓ Faculty ID automatically set when faculty submit grades
✓ Case-sensitive role comparison handled appropriately

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Input Validation**: Add comprehensive validation annotations to Grade model
2. **Audit Logging**: Implement logging for all grade operations
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **Grade History**: Implement versioning for grade changes
5. **Additional Security Headers**: Add security headers like X-Content-Type-Options

## Compliance Status

### CSSECDV Requirements Met:
- ✓ 2.1.1: Authentication required for all pages except public
- ✓ 2.2.1: Single site-wide authorization component
- ✓ 2.2.2: Access controls fail securely (deny by default)
- ✓ 2.2.3: Business logic flow enforcement

### Partial Compliance:
- ⚠️ 2.3.1: Input validation (validation exists but no annotations)

## Conclusion

The Grade Service has been successfully secured with proper authentication and authorization controls. All critical vulnerabilities have been remediated, and comprehensive test coverage ensures the security controls function as expected. The service now properly enforces role-based access control and fails securely for all authorization attempts.
